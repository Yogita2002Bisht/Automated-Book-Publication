* **Tone:** Shifts inconsistently between poetic/evocative and blunt/action-oriented.  The internal monologue sections feel jarring against the more descriptive passages.

* **Flow:**  The narrative jumps around a bit.  The extended imagined conversation with Tari feels like an info dump.  The section describing the escape from Palm Tree is repetitive.

* **Readability:** Mostly good, but some sentences are overly long and complex.  The frequent use of italics for emphasis feels heavy-handed. The repeated use of "his" and possessive language in the early section is a bit repetitive.  The ending feels rushed.
