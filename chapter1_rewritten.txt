## Chapter 1: The Canoe Builder

Dick perched on a coral ledge, his gaze fixed on the southern horizon.  Behind him, the ocean roared, a tempest of crashing waves and wind-whipped spray.  Before him, the Karolin lagoon lay serene – a vast, sapphire expanse shimmering under the sun, patrolled by circling gulls.  This forty-mile-wide coral ring, this tranquil inland sea that could transform into a raging storm at a moment’s notice, was *his*. And he’d only arrived yesterday.

The beach bustled with activity.  Women, children, and young men toiled under the relentless sun – fishing, playing, tending their taro patches. They were all *his* people now.  The canoes beached on the sand, the empty houses that once housed war canoes – all were his.

His eyes shifted from the lagoon to the canoe houses, a frown etching his brow.  He turned, facing the relentless ocean waves and the northern sea.  Beyond the horizon, invisible but ever-present in his mind, lay Palm Tree Island – a paradise cloaked in a terrifying reality.  A beautiful dream, teeming with devils.

Little Tari, Le Taioi the net-maker's son, watched him from the coral. Tari, a child untouched by the harsh realities of life, understood only that the men of Karolin lost to war had left the women and children vulnerable, leaderless.  Then, yesterday, a strange boat had arrived from the north, carrying Dick and Katafa – the girl lost at sea years ago.  The women whispered that they were sent by the gods, destined to rule.

Tari, unburdened by the complexities of faith, looked at Dick and blurted out his childlike question:  “Taori,” he said, “who are you?”

Could Dick explain? Could a child comprehend the extraordinary journey he’d endured?  He *could* have told him:  "Tari, I'm from a world beyond your understanding. My name is Dick Lestrange, and as a child, I was left alone on that island you call Marua (Palm Tree) with an old sailor named Kearney. He taught me to survive, to fish, and he built me toys – little ships unlike your canoes. Then Katafa arrived, the girl who’d been lost. After Kearney died, we were alone together.  She taught me your language. She called me Taori. We loved each other and might have lived forever on Marua if it weren't for the brutal men from the Melanesian islands. They came to cut down the trees, murdered the white men, burned the ship. We escaped in our little boat, guided by the lagoon's light, and here we are."

But he couldn’t.  The name Dick, the language of his childhood, were fading memories. Kearney, his surrogate father, was a shadowy figure in the luminous haze of his past. For a man lost at sea for so long, the past blurs, becoming fogged.  Dick’s memories only sharpened with Katafa’s arrival on Marua. Everything else – consumed by the scorching sun, the raging storms, the misty rains – was lost.  Only Kearney’s tiny toy ships remained as tangible links to a forgotten time.

He looked down at the inquisitive child.  “I am Taori, Tari. Why do you ask?”

“I don’t know,” Tari replied, his attention already shifting.  “I ask like I breathe, but grown-ups never answer Tari’s questions.  Ai! The fish!” He ran off, his curiosity piqued by the children hauling in a net.

Dick’s gaze returned to the north.  Tari’s question had stirred his memories.  He saw the burning schooner, his escape with Katafa in Kearney’s old dinghy.  He saw their arrival on this beach, the women and children who now looked to him as their divinely appointed leader. But the memory of his escape was tainted by the brutality of the men he’d left behind.

There wasn't an immediate threat. The men on Palm Tree lacked canoes. But they *would* build them. They would see the shimmering reflection of the Karolin lagoon and they would come.  It might be a long time, but they would come.

Dick was a kanaka, a savage in many ways, but the white man within him persisted. He could strategize, plan, anticipate.

That's why he'd sent a canoe for Aioma, Palia, and Tafata – three elderly but skilled canoe builders. That's why, when looking at the tribe, his eyes had lit upon the almost hundred young men reaching fighting age.  And beneath it all, fueling his ambition, soaring like an eagle, was his love for Katafa, his other half, his very life, ever so subtly threatened.

War canoes!  Would he defend the lagoon? Launch a preemptive strike?  The answer remained elusive.

A hand touched his shoulder.  He turned to see Katafa, a strand of her dark hair escaping the vine that bound it, fluttering in the breeze like an eagle's feather. Her luminous eyes weren’t on him; they were fixed on the north, the same direction as his gaze.

“Look,” she breathed.

Palm Tree, at certain times and under specific weather conditions, appeared through the mirage.  They’d seen it last night and now, once more, it was emerging – a hazy smudge low on the horizon, gradually sharpening, until it materialized, a breathtakingly beautiful island.

Shoulder to shoulder, they stood in silent communion, their minds untutored in the science of mirages, their eyes fixed on the place of their escape.

They saw the savage horde, monstrous figures from a nightmare. They felt the wind in their sails as they fled for safety.  They heard the Melanesians’ bloodcurdling yells.  And there it was, that idyllic scene masking the demons it harbored.

As Dick gazed upon this beauty, this threat, his nostrils flared, his eyes burning with hate.  They had threatened *him*.  But they had threatened *Katafa*.  And that was everything. The threat lingered.

One day, they would come. Palm Tree's reappearance seemed to confirm his instincts. They would build canoes, see the lagoon's light, and they would come. Those men had no women.  And Karolin had plenty.  He felt a primal instinct at work, a mirroring of his own attraction to Katafa.

The danger, he realized, wasn’t just in the north, but wherever greed and hatred roamed the azure sea.  It wasn’t just savages; it was the wolves of civilization.

To Dick, the world was limited to the water that surrounded the two islands.  No Europe, no America, no history beyond his and Katafa's short lives. Yet, even in that short life, he’d learned to fear men, to understand the fundamental truth of history: man’s innate capacity for war, plunder, and destruction.

Slowly, the vision of Palm Tree faded, vanished like a snuffed candle.  Turning from the sea to the lagoon, Katafa pointed to an approaching canoe.

It was the one Dick had sent for the canoe builders. Leaving the coral ledge, they walked towards the beach to meet it.
